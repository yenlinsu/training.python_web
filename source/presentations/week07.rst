**Team 4**:

**Leader**: Jason

**Members**:  Daniel, Conor, Maria

.. class:: incremental

**Your Task**: WYSIWYG Editing with ``django-ckeditor``

My Guidelines
-------------

Each team can work from a single *core* repository.

.. class:: incremental

Break the job into discreet tasks.

.. class:: incremental

Work in twos or threes, each small group take a task and complete it.

.. class:: incremental

Create a local branch. Complete your task then merge.

.. class:: incremental

Team leaders manage communications, keep an eye on the big picture.

First Step - Setup
------------------

Get a 'core' repository (perhaps leaders fork mine)::

    https://github.com/cewing/training.django_microblog

.. class:: incremental

Add your teammates as **collaborators**:

.. class:: incremental

* In your browser, view the repo you'll be working from in github.
* Click on the 'settings' tab (in the grey bar below the repo name)
* Click on the 'collaborators' menu item on the left
* Add your teammates by github id to the list of collaborators

.. class:: incremental

Now you should **all** have read-write access to this *core* repo.

Second Step - Workflow
----------------------

Each small group, pick a *driver*

.. class:: incremental

Each driver, clone the *core* repo to your local machine

.. class:: incremental

Pick a task. **Before** you start to work, make a local branch:

.. class:: incremental

::

    $ git checkout -b <task_name>

.. class:: incremental

Complete your task, making commits as you go (you're on a branch)

Third Step - Cleanup
--------------------

When you're finished with a task, you'll merge your branch:

.. class:: incremental small

::

    $ git branch
      master
    * <task_name>
    $ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'
    $ git pull origin master
    From ...
     * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
    Already up-to-date.
    $ git merge <task_name>
    $ git push origin master

.. class:: incremental

Rinse and repeat

In The End
----------

Leaders, make a copy of the *core* repository on your machine

.. class:: incremental

When your team is done, set up your machine to show off your results

.. class:: incremental

At 8:30 we'll come together. Each team will have 5 minutes to show a quick
demo of their work, and say something about what they learned along the way.

Almost There
------------

.. class:: big-centered

Any Questions?

And Now
-------

.. class:: big-centered

**begin**

Reference
---------

A Few useful git commands:

.. class:: small

::

    $ git clone <repo_url>          # make a clone
    $ git checkout -b <branch_name> # make a new local branch
    $ git checkout master           # return to the master
    $ git branch                    # list branches (and show current)
    $ git commit -m "message"       # make a commit locally
    $ git pull [origin [branch]]    # pull recent changes from remote
    $ git push [origin [branch]]    # push committed changes to remote
    $ git merge <branch_name>       # merge changes from other to current

Assignment
----------

For this week, you have *no* code assignment. 

.. class:: incremental

Instead I want you to focus on installing software and reading for next week.
Software we'll be installing uses C extensions, and so installing it on OS X
or Linux requires a compiler and python's development headers.

.. class:: incremental

There are a few steps here, so follow along carefully.

Assignment - Linux Prep
-----------------------

For Linux machines, we'll need to have ``gcc`` (a c compiler) and python's
development headers in order to complete our tasks. The VMs we have access to
already have ``gcc`` installed, so all we need there is::

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev

Assignment - OSX Prep
---------------------

OS X does not come with a c compiler installed. You'll need to have XCode
installed. It's free, but *big* expect it to take a while if you don't already
have it.

Once it is installed, there's one more step, you have to install the
'optional' command line tools:

* Launch XCode
* From the XCode menu, click 'preferences' > 'Downloads' > 'Install Command
  Line Tools'
* Once it completes, you can quit XCode again.  

Assignment - Windows Prep
-------------------------

There are pre-compiled binaries available for Windows, but we need one
``.bat`` file in order to properly install them. We'll need to install Visual
Studio 2008 Express to get this file (if you already have another copy of VS,
you can probably skip this)

.. class:: small

* Download the installer (894MB):
  http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/B/5/8B5804AD-4990-40D0-A6AA-CE894CBBB3DC/VS2008ExpressENUX1397868.iso
* Extract the files to a folder (call it VS2008ExpressENUX1397868â€”it will be
  2.68GB) using something like 7zip
* Inside that folder double-click on Setup.hta
* On the screen that comes up, click on the installer for Visual C++ 2008
  Express Edition and follow the instructions. **Note**: It does work if you
  include the following two options which are pre-selected for you: (1) MSDN
  Express Library for Visual Studio 2008, and (2) Microsoft SQL Server 2005
  Express Edition (x86).

Assignment - Virtualenv
-----------------------

With that prep work out of the way, you're ready to start. First, set up a
virtualenv:

.. class:: incremental

::

    $ python2.6 virtualenv.py --distribute pyramidenv
    ...
    $ source pyramidenv/bin/activate
    (pyramidenv)$ 

.. class:: incremental

Remeber, Windows users: ``> pyramidenv\Scripts\activate``

Assignment - Install Pyramid
----------------------------

Once you've got a virtualenv set up and ready to go, install Pyramid:

.. class:: incremental

::

    (pyramidenv)$ easy_install pyramid

.. class:: incremental

This will install a number of dependency packages, do not be alarmed.

.. class:: incremental

Next, we'll install a different kind of Database, the ZODB.

Assignment - Install ZODB
-------------------------

If you're on OS X or Linux::

    (pyramidenv)$ easy_install ZODB3==3.10.5

This will take some time. If you get errors, contact me directly or via the
Google Group.

Windows users, you'll have it a bit easier here. You have to install a binary
egg::

    [pyramidenv]> pip install --egg ZODB3==3.10.5

Pause for Self Evaluation
-------------------------

At this point, you can check your work. Fire up a python interpreter in your
virtualenv::

    (pyramidenv)$ python
    >>> import ZODB
    >>> ^D
    (pyramidenv)$

If you get an ImportError when you try that, you're not done.  Contact me.

Assignment - Extras
-------------------

Next, we'll need to finish installing the bits we need for our work next
week::

    (pyramidenv)$ easy_install docutils nose coverage
    ...
    (pyramidenv)$ easy_install pyramid_zodbconn pyramid_tm
    ...
    (pyramidenv)$ easy_install pyramid_debugtoolbar

.. class:: incremental

These tools will allow us to manage ZODB connections, debug our app, and run
cool tests.

Assignment - Set Up Project
---------------------------

And finally, we'll set up a project for ourselves. This is like running
'startproject' for django in a way:

.. class:: incremental small

    (pyramidenv)$ pcreate -s zodb wikitutorial

.. class:: incremental small center

Do not be alarmed by the 'sorry for the convenience' message.

.. class:: incremental

You get a folder called ``wikitutorial``. In it you should see files like
``setup.py`` and ``development.ini`` among others.

.. class:: incremental

This is an installable ``package``. You can install this package with
easy_install.

Final Self Evaluation
---------------------

In fact, let's do that now, so we can prove to ourselves this all worked::

    (pyramidenv)$ cd wikitutorial
    (pyramidenv)$ python setup.py develop
    ...

.. class:: incremental

You'll see a bunch of output.  When it's over, run tests:

.. class:: incremental

::

    (pyramidenv)$ python setup.py test -q
    
Congratulations
---------------

When you've made it this far, and you see 1 test run successfully, you're
done.

If you like, you can see your work by running the new project::

    (pyramidenv)$ pserve development.ini
    Starting server in PID 3056.
    serving on http://0.0.0.0:6543

Visit ``http://localhost:6543`` to see your work in action. then go grab a
beer and curl up with the reading for the week. There's a lot.
