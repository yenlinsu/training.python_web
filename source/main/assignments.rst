Assignments
===========

All assignments for the course will be submitted using the Github
fork-and-pull model.  Here are the steps you'll need to complete to do the job:

1. Log in to the github website

2. Visit my repository for the class documentation:
   http://github.com/cewing/training.python_web

3. In the top right corner of the repository listing, find the button labelled
   'Fork'. Click it to fork the repository.

4. After a short while, you'll find that you now have a copy of this
   repository in your own github account. Clone that to your own machine:
   
   ``git clone http://github.com/<username>/training.python_web.git``

5. Complete the assignment, placing your final scripts into the
   ``assignments/weekNN/athome`` directory in the clone on your local machine.

6. Commit your changes to the repository (you'll need to ``git add`` new files
   you create, then ``git commit`` them, e.g.:

   ``git commit <file> -m "some steps I took to complete the assignment"``

7. Push your committed changes back to your github account:
   
   ``git push origin master``

8. Back on the github website, click on the 'Pull Request' button at the top
   of the page listing your fork of my repository (the copy in your account).
   You can write a note to me if you like when you make your pull request.

From step 8, I'll get an email that tells me that you have made a pull
request. That email will contain links to your fork of my repository. I can
use that link to review the changes you've made. After I've reviewed your
assignment, I'll close the pull request because I don't actually want to pull
your changes for this assignment into my repository.

That'll be all.
