Final Project
=============

This course has a **Final Project** which is an integral part of the
evaluation. Students must complete the final project to successfully pass the
course.

Project Parameters
------------------

* Create a Website
* It can do anything you want it to. 
* It should have some user interactions (forms users complete).
* It should look nice
* It should show off some aspect of what you've learned
* It should take you about 15-20 hours to create (so small)
* It will be due Friday following the last day of class (March 15)

Students should check with the instructor or TA to ensure project scope is
appropriate for the time available.

Much of the class time in weeks 9 and 10 will be devoted to working on this
project. Students will be able to work directly with the instructor and TA to
answer questions and get assistance.

Submitting The Project
----------------------

The assignment is due at the end of the last week of class.

Assignments will be submitted via an email containing:

* A Link to the project site **running online**
* A Link to **the project source code repository** in Github.
* Text describing **the goals and outcomes** of the project. (This can also
  be in the form of a README in the source code repository)
* Instructions on **how to run the project locally** on a laptop (including
  information about any required packages or non-python software required)

Evaluating the Project
----------------------

For evaluation purposes, the running site is the vital part. The instructor
will compare the description of project goals with the running site to see if
the goals were met.
