Assignment
==========

Begin work on your Final Project. The parameters are listed below:

* Create a Website
* It can do anything you want it to. 
* It should have some user interactions (forms users complete).
* It should look nice-ish
* It should show off some aspect of what you've learned
* It should take you about 15-20 hours to create (so small)
* It will be due Friday following the last day of class (March 15)

Remember to check in with Dan or me before you begin work on the project to
ensure that you haven't bitten off more than you can chew in the time you
have.

If you are having difficulty getting started, contact Dan or me. We are here
to help you get this done.

We will be spending most of class in weeks 9 and 10 working on this. That will
be your opportunity to get help directly from Dan or me. Please prepare
yourselves to take advantage of this by working ahead so you have specific,
solvable problems we can address.

Submitting The Assignment
=========================

The assignment is due by Friday, March 15 at noon. I will not accept
assignments turned in later than that.

Your assignment will be completed when you email me the following:

* A Link to your site **running on your bluebox VM**
* A Link to **your project source code repository** in Github.
* Text describing **the goals and outcomes** of your project. (This can also
  be in the form of a README in your repository)
* Instructions on **how I can run your project locally** on my laptop (Do I
  need to install anything special in a virtualenv? Will I need a particular
  database? Anything else I'll need to know?)

Evaluating the Project
======================

For evaluation purposes, the site running on your VM is the vital part. I will
look there to see if you've gotten your site to run. I will judge the app
based on the text you write describing your goals. If that text is missing, I
will not be able to judge the completeness of your outcome. For this reason,
the text describing your project is a **vital** part of the submission. Do not
overlook it.

I will *not* be grading you on the style of your code. That being said, neat,
clean, pep8 compliant code will keep me happy and can only help. Strive to be
as *pythonic* as you can.
