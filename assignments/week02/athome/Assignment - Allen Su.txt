hi Chris, sorry for the late submission.  I stunbled across several challenges that took me a long time to resolve.

I was able to finish the labs and the assignment up to the "dynamic time-page" point, without the bonus (running it on the VM).

However, in I ran into an issue that I can't figure out.  I added another directory (web/images/test), and a file inside that directory (web/images/test/test.txt).

the URI works fine until the test.txt file.  For some reason, when I click the link on that file, the URI being passed with the request becomes /images/images/test/test.txt,
which then resulted a 404 error.

Thanks,

Allen Su
