Using what you've learned this week, create a more complex mashup of some data
that interests you. Map the locations of the breweries near your house. Chart
a multi-axial graph of the popularity of various cities across several
categories.  Visualize the most effective legislators in Congress.  You have
interests, the Web has tools.  Put them together to make something.

Place the following in the ``assignments/week03/athome`` directory and make a
pull request:

.. class:: small

A textual description of your mashup.
  What data sources did you scan, what tools did you use, what is the
  outcome you wanted to create?

.. class:: small

Your source code.
  Give me an executable python script that I can run to get output.

.. class:: small

Any instructions I need.
  If I need instructions beyond 'python myscript.py' to get the right
  output, let me know.
