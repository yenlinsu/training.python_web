Using what you've learned this week, Attempt the following:

* Create a small, multi-page WSGI application
* Use ``assignments/week04/athome/bookdb.py`` as a data source
* Your app index page should list the books in the db
* Each listing should supply a link to a detail page
* Each detail page should list information about the book

HINT:

Use the Armin Ronacher reading from the class outline as a source for hints:

Submitting Your Work:

This week we are going to do something a bit different. Get your application
running on your VM. Then add the following to ``assignments/week04/athome``
and submit a pull request:

* A README.txt file containing the URL I can visit to see your application.
  You can also put questions or comments in this file.

* Your source code, whatever is up on your VM.
