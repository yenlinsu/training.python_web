Assignment

* Review the data structure and views required for the Flaskr app.

* Start a new *app* in your same `mysite` project.  Call it `djangor`

* Build the required models to represent the data.  Make two enhancements:
  
  * Add a column for 'pub_date' to the entry model
  
  * Allow each entry to be 'owned' by a User. Add a relation field to
    represent this.
  
  * *HINT* ``django.contrib.auth.models`` defines a ``User`` model.

* Build the urlconf required to present an entry list and a view for posting a
  new entry.  Add two new urls:
  
  * One should show the archive of all posts from a given month and year
  
  * One should show all the posts by a single user

* Build views for each URL
