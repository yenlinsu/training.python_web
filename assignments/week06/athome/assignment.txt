As described in class, we've divided into teams for Week 07. Our assignment
for week six is also divided. Each team has a team leader, they have one
assignment, described below. The remaining members of each team have a second
assignment, also described below.

Team Leader Assignment

If you are a team leader, your assignment is to formulate a plan to implement
one of the following features as an extension to the djangor micro-blog app
your team members are building. Please pick one feature and communicate your
plan to me before the start of class on Tuesday, Feb. 19:

* User Registration (django-registration)
* 'Archive' views based on date or author (generic date-based views)
* WYSIWYG visual editor for entry posts. (django-ckeditor)
* Tagging (django-taggit)
* Theme (make it beautiful)

Team Member Assignment
----------------------

* Review the data structure and views required for the Flaskr app.

* Start a new *app* in your same `mysite` project.  Call it `djangor`

* Build the required models to represent the data.  Make two enhancements:

  new entry.
